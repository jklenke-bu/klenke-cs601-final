                <p>My interest in computers and electronics began when I was in preschool.
                    I started by taking my toys apart to try and understand how they worked.
                    Later, I started playing on video game consoles and eventually computers.
                    When I was old enough to get my driver's license, I started building and
                    fixing computers for people as a way to make money.

                <p>After high school, I attended a trade school and traditional college before
                    settling for online school. I earned a Bachelor's and Master's degree in IT
                    related fields. Now I'm back again for a second Master's. Through that time, 
                    I've changed jobs a handful of times to go from Systems Administrator, 
                    Tech Lead, Ops Manager, Cybersecurity Analyst, and finally DevSecOps Engineer.

            <p>One software product I've used a lot in past few years is 
            <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>. The team behind Kubernetes has a 
            theme and accompanying graphic logo to go with each release. Here are some of 
            my favorites.</p>
